# LootBot

LootBot is a work in progress hobbyproject for one of my own discord servers, meaning to deliver some entertainment when just chatting.
The code is to be seen as example / learning for your own bot.

Currently my own version of LootBot is running on Heroku and using a MongoDB hosted on mLab to save user data.
